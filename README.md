This project presents a 2D vine growth generator and renderer that stores the traversal of vines in UV space, and renders these vines onto textures in real-time. 
This is primarily achieved through an implementation of Space Colonization Algorithms, first introduced by Runions et al.  
The project also implements an interface in Unity that allows users to easily fine tune several parameters, allowing them to modify growth behaviour in several unique ways.
This project was completed by Adam Khaddaj and Karim Tantawy.
