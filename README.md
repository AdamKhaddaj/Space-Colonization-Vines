This project presents a 2D vine growth generator and renderer that stores the traversal of vines growths in UV space, and renders these vines onto textures in real-time.

This is primarily achieved through an implementation of Space Colonization Algorithms, first introduced by Runions et al.

This project also implements a simple interface through the Unity inspector that allows users to tweak several paramters for altering growth behaviours, including branching frequency, inclusion/exclusion zones, leaf generation, vine overlap, vine thickness, and more.

Instructions for installing and using this tool can be found on the "Set-Up Instructions" pdf.

A more thorough breakdown of this project can be found in the COMP4900_FinalProjectReport.pdf.
