This project presents a 2D vine growth generator and renderer that stores the tra-
versal of vines in UV space, and renders these vines to a texture in real-time. This
is primarily achieved through an implementation of Space Colonization Algorithms,
first introduced by Runions. The project also implements an interface in Unity that
allows users to easily fine tune several parameters, allowing them to determine where
and how vines grow.
